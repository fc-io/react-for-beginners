* Notice that when he uses axios he could more or less have used fetch without
  making any difference.
* Also notice, at the end, when he talks about mutation; that it's in general
  considered an anti-pattern to have stuff randomly jump in and change the
  layout. Its better to either:
    - Show a button that say that there is more content, and then the user can
      decide when to load new content.
    - Or to wait for the new data before loading the page in the first place.

## Assignment – recreate and improve

* Create a new Git/GitHub repo.
* Recreate the code/steps of the presentation
* ...but fetch data from another data source (than mine).
  * Examples of APIs that don't require authentication:
    https://github.com/cezary/simple-apis or find one of your own choosing.
  * API should provide data than can be used in a list or table (most likely
    provided from an array).
* Find a new style from https://dribbble.com/tags/free
  * The design picked should have a list or table that you can copy for your
    data.
* Implement the design using your data.
  - Should look like a list or table (but does not need to use <table> or
    <ul>, <dl>, <ol>).
* BONUS: Make the site mobile as well as desktop friendly. Adapt design style as
  you see fit.
* Give credit on your page towards the style you picked. Provide a link to
  where you found the style.
* Publish your site. You can use GitHub pages, Netlify or Vercel.
* Make sure to commit and push latest to GitHub repo.
* Make sure to provide a link to the repo and the site in the assignment hand-in
  in teams.
