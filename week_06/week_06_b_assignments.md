## Assignment – Improve upon week 5

* Don't use any dom manipulation abilities like document.querySelector.
* Don't remove StrictMode
* Use eslint, add a custom configuration/style-guide to extend, also
  add at least one rule change
* Run all files in the app folder through prettier using npm. Add a custom prettier config with at
  least one setting changed.
* BONUS: Create an easter egg
  * Add a home-icon/text/button (if there isn't one already).
  * Clicking the home button should take you back to the home page unless you
    already are on the home page.
  * When you press the home icon/text twice on the home page the home button
    should wiggle and then fly away (in a speed you can see). Make sure it's two clicks/presses in a row. Not one click then going to another page and coming back and then another click. If you click somewhere else on the home page then it's fine if the next click will trigger the wiggle and disappear.
  * The home button should now be gone on all pages until a refresh of the page.
