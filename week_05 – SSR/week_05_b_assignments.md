## Assignment – Portfolio (again, yey!)

* Build a (new-isch) Portfolio site using Next. You can reuse a lot of code from
  the old one you made in the previous course as well as the design you used
  in the previous course. Or you can make a new (simpler) one.
* There should, at least, be a portfolio page and an about page with different
  routes.
* Link to all the sites and GitHub projects you've made in this course so far
  * From Week 01: Link to the GitHub repo for Week 1.
  * From Week 02: Link to the GitHub repo for Week 2.
  * From Week 03: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  * From Week 04: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  * From Week 05, this week: Link to site (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and GitHub repo
* Make sure to provide some kind of image that reflect the work you've done each
  week.
    * Either a snippet or a scaled down image of a site.
    * For week 2, the image can be of how it looks in the terminal when you run
      your program or how the generated HTML page looks like.
* BONUS: Add a custom 404 page (watch video for example).
* Publish your site. You can use GitHub pages, Netlify or Vercel.
* Commit and push to a new GitHub repo.
* Make sure to provide a link to the repo and the site in the assignment hand-in
  in teams.
