## Assignment – Portfolio (again, yey!) (Alternative 1)

* Build a (new-isch) Portfolio site using Next. You can reuse a lot of code from
  the old one you made in the previous course as well as the design you used
  in the previous course. Or you can make a new (simpler) one.
* There should, at least, be a portfolio page and an about page with different
  routes.
* Link to all the sites and GitHub projects you've made in this course so far
  * From Week 01: Link to the GitHub repo for Week 1.
  * From Week 02: Link to the GitHub repo for Week 2.
  * From Week 03: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  * From Week 04: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  * From Week 05, this week: Link to site (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and GitHub repo
* Make sure to provide some kind of image that reflect the work you've done each
  week.
    * Either a snippet or a scaled down image of a site.
    * For week 1 and 2, the image can be of how it looks in the terminal when
      you run your program or how the generated HTML page looks like.
* BONUS: Add a custom 404 page (watch video for example).
* Publish your site. You can use GitHub pages, Netlify or Vercel.
* Commit and push to a new GitHub repo.
* In the assignment hand-in, make sure to provide a link to the repo, a
  screenshot of the site, and a link to the site.

## Assignment – Alternative 2, pick you own thing.

(Since the last assignment of the course will be a group asssignment for a
customer, I'd like you to have another opportunity to work on something you
yourself are passionate about building.)

**You can only pick alternative 2,if you ask about your idé before Wednesday 11:59 during week 5.** Otherwise you have to do alternative 1.

* Build a site using Next.
* Your site need to use routes; there should be at least 3. 
* Pick your own idea for the assignment, but don't go overboard. It's just one
  week.
   - You can choose to work on small part of larger project. But whatever you
     build should work on it's own. No broken links. No half-done features not
     working to be later improved upon.
* **You need to get your idea approved before you start. Send me a message and
    ask.**
* BONUS: Add a custom 404 page (watch video for example).
* Publish your site. You can use GitHub pages, Netlify or Vercel.
* Commit and push to a new GitHub repo.
* In the assignment hand-in, make sure to provide a link to the repo, a
  screenshot of the site, and a link to the site.
