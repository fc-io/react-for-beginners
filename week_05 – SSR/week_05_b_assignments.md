# Week 5 – SSR

// To be done

## Porfolio

* Build a (new-isch) Porfolio site. You can reuse a lot of code from the old one
  you made in the previous course as well as the design you used last time. Or
  you can make a new simplier one.
* Link to all the sites and github projects you've made in this course so far
  * From Week 01: Link to the GitHub repo for Week 1.
  * From Week 02: Link to the GitHub repo for Week 2.
  * From Week 03: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  * From Week 04: Link to the published site and GitHub repo
  * From Week 05, this week: Link to site (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and GitHub repo
* Make sure to provide some kind of image that reflect the work you've done each
  week.
    * Either a snippet or a scaled down image of a site.
    * For week 2, the image can be of how it looks in the terminal when you run
      your program or how the generated html page looks like.
* Commit a and push to a new github repo.
* Publish your site.
* Make sure to provide a link to the repo and the site in the assignment hand-in
  in teams.
