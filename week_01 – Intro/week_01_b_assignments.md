# Vecka 1 – Intro

**Basics + html/css + Interactivity 1**

### Show – React basics

Start from a pre made template in an in-browser editor.

* Build a basic page layout.
* Add a some kind of geometric shape.
* Add another geometric shape.
* Add a button that switches between the shapes.

Show how the documentation, stackoverlflow, GPT, and copilot can help

### Assignment – recreate and improve

* recreate the code/steps of the presentation
* but use shapes, and colors of your own chosing
* also add an additional shape
* the button should switch between all three shapes
* make the button reflect wich shape is shown
* update the title, you can watch the video below for an example if we don't go through this during class

You should be ready to show your result/progress during our next class. But don't need to be finished until next week.

### Assignment – First idea

Start thinking about a super simple react program that you would like to make (for next week). Either a copy of something that already exists or something new that you would like to make. Later during the course there will be opportunites to make more advanced programs but right now we want something super simple and focus mostly on styling/css.

Exempel: Vecka.nu (som uppdaterar vecka utan omladdning, cool if the title can reflect that when pinned, make sure to test by changing the time), Räkna ut många bokstäver/tecken/ord som finns i en text. Random generator, flip a coin, like a dice. (Calculator and TODO-app too large this early on, except for overly very ambitious students)

Your idea should later on be added to a github repo; for now you can jot it down wherever, or keep in your mind.

### Assignment – Find a style

Hitta en designstil som du vill insperars från i din app. Förslagsvis från något på https://dribbble.com/.

Lägg till en map till ert repo, men bilder på stilen. Om ni vill ha olika stilar beroende på vilken idé ni i slutändan väljer lägg i olika mappar.
