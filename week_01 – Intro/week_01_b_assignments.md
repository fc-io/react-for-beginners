# Week 1 – Intro: Assignments

**Basics + HTML/CSS + Interactivity 1**

## Show – React basics

~~In order to quickly get familiar with React, we shall, for this week, use an
online boilerplate at https://codesandbox.io/s/react-new. You can create an
account if you like. The important part is that you save you work as we will
build on it further in the coming weeks.~~

* NEW: Set up node, npm and vite.

* Build a basic page layout,
* Add an article, with at least one heading, and some content.
  * Add an image to the article.
* Add another article with the same setup as above.
* Add a button that switches between the articles.

* Talk about state.
* Show how the documentation, stack overflow, GPT, and copilot can help.
* Talk about updating state.
* Talk about updating state with objects.

* Implement a nicer design

## Assignment – recreate and improve

* Recreate the code/steps of the presentation
* ...but use content, styling and images of your own choosing
* The 1st article should be about you what you've done so far when it comes to
  programming and what you would like to explore further on. A couple of
  sentences is enough.
* The 2nd article should be about your idea for you first personal project
  (see below). The name of the idea/project and a motivation to why you choose
  that idea. A couple of sentences is enough.
* An additional article, the 3rd article, should be about the design style you
  wish to apply to your first personal project (see below for instructions).
  Include a motivation as to why you picked that style. A couple of sentences is
  enough.
* Add buttons that switch between all three articles (like pagination).
* Make the button reflect which article is shown. (I.e. the button for a given
  article has another styling than the other buttons when the active article is
  shown.)
* BONUS: Add a button that shows all articles at the same time.
* BONUS: update the title depending on what article is shown. You can watch the
  video below for an example if we don't go through this during class
* Make sure you commit and push your work to a public github repo, and when you
  are done with all the assignments, add a link in the assignment for week 1.

You should be ready to show your result/progress during our next lecture. ~~But you
don't need to be finished until our first lecture next week.~~

Watch:

**How to use useState/useEffect**

We will talk more about useEffect in another lecture but nice if you watch that part
too.

**Learn React #5: Maps and Loops in JSX**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5llXA0RTYIU

**Optional: 10 React Hooks Explained https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNhaISOUy6Q**

Might be better to watch this later on. But nice to watch it during the course.

## Assignment – Idea for First Personal React Project

Start thinking about a super simple react site that you would like to make
(for week 3). Either a copy of something that already exists or something new
that you would like to make. Later during the course there will be
opportunities to make more advanced programs but right now we want something
super simple and focus mostly on styling/CSS.

Examples:
* Calculate letters/characters/words in a text.
* Random number generator: flip a coin or like a dice (1-6).
* Vecka.nu (that updates without refresh, cool if the title can reflect that
  when pinned, make sure to test by changing the time on your computer),
* Calculate how many days it is until Christmas or until next CSN payment, or
  whatever (We will talk about how to work with dates and time next week).

(Calculator and TODO-app too large of a project at this stage.)

~~Your idea should later on be added to a github repo (we will go about how to use
git and github next week).~~

Your idea should later be added to your project and the github repo.

## Assignment – Styling of First Personal React Project

Find a visual style to use for your "First idea"-app. A suggestion is to pick
something from https://dribbble.com/tags/free. Typeface, colors and icons would
be something for you to modify if you like, but other that that your app should
match the design you pick very closely.

~~Also to be included in you github repo later on (for now you can save a
link for yourself).~~

Your idea should later be added to your project and the github repo.
