## React – Why use?

### Compared to jQuery/"vanilla JavaScript".

### Speed

* It was "faster" then comparable tools (templates etc) at the time.
* How about today?

### Complexity

* When an application grows bigger it help to have a common structure to reason
  about. otherwise everything becomes a tangled mess.

### When React?

* React is the best tool for many things, but not all the things
* What does frameworks like react solve?
* What makes front-end exiting/though?
* Usage: https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/
* All the moving parts node vs deno vs bun. npm vs yarn vs pnpm vs npx vs nvm.

### Examples of React usage.

* Wappalyzer

* https://www.instagram.com/
* https://www.netflix.com/
* https://www.tiktok.com/
* https://www.airbnb.com/

## Importance of being you own teacher

## Tools for learning (and coding)

I'd like for you to start using many of the tools that I and plenty of other
developers use when coding.

* YouTube
* Stack overflow
* Documentation
* ChatGPT/Github copilot

### The Job Market

* The dominant JavaScript framework.
* How to get a React job – your first job is usually the hardest to get.
* What else will you need in addition to this course?
  * more practice
  * typescript
  * (react native, SSR – next.js, should prob have time to introduce next)
  * (Docker)
  * (old style of writing react)

### When you get the job – Imposter syndrome

* Why it's important to know about
* How to overcome

### About the Assignments

* The assignments *are* this course!
* I will live code most of the key aspects of many of the assignments you'll go
  through.
* Everything that I show, you will also do in some form. For repetition. And to
  make mistakes that will make you learn better.
* Then you should extend with additional functionality. Bonus tasks if you'd
  like a higher grade (all bonus tasks should be done to receive a higher
  grade).
* When live coding I will not wait for you to follow along. You can if you like,
  but the important part is that you watch and follow. You will get plenty of
  time to figure it out for yourself later. I will publish most/all of the code
  I write for you to access later and feel free to take photos, screenshots or
  record. I will also add several videos that will explain important concepts
  in more depth.
* We'll begin most lectures by one of you showing your progress or results.
