## Main topics of the course

* React! And an assortment of libraries to use React efficiently.
* Node
* NPM
* (Git och GitHub)

## React – Why use?

### Compared to jQuery/"vanilla JavaScript".

### SPA (vs ordinary sites/MPA)

### Speed

* It was "faster" then comparable tools (templates etc) at the time.
* How about today?

### Complexity

* When an application grows bigger it help to have a common structure to reason
  about.

### When React?

* React is the best tool for many things, but not all the things
* What does frameworks like react solve?
* What makes front-end exiting/though?
* Usage: https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/
* All the moving parts node vs deno vs bun. npm vs yarn vs pnpm vs npx vs nvm.
* When other frameworks?

### Other frameworks

* Angular
* Vue
* Svelte.js
* Preact
* Solid.js
* Qwik
* Fresh (deno)
* (Marko, for mpa/documents, not SPA)

* SSR React – Next.js, Remix (and Astro)

### Examples of React usage.

* etc...

### More

Later on we'll talk a bit about what makes react work under the hood.

## What is Node?

Brief intro. How it works and how to use it we'll talk more about Node later on.

## What is npm?

Briefly. Bundled with node.

## Importance of being you own teacher

## Tools for learning (and coding)

I'd like for you to start using many of the tools that I and plenty of other
developers use when coding.

* YouTube/Twitch
* Stack overflow
* Documentation
* ChatGPT/Github copilot
* Twitter/mastodon (and reddit)
    * @slicknet
    * @FredKSchott
    * @ChromiumDev
    * the frameworks you are interested in.

## The Job Market

* The dominant JavaScript framework.
* How to get a React job – your first job is usually the hardest to get.
* What else will you need in addition to this course?
  * more practice
  * typescript
  * testing
  * (React Native)
  * (Docker)
  * (old style of writing react)
  * (some backend knowledge, though not really)

### When you get the job

#### Imposter syndrome

* Why it's important to know about
* How to overcome

#### Working with others

* Backend
* UI/UX
* Project managers

#### Make sure you have/take the time to learn new things

## About the Assignments

* The assignments *are* this course!
* I will live code most of the key aspects of many of the assignments you'll go
  through.
* Everything that I show, you will also do in some form. For repetition. And to
  make mistakes that will make you learn better.
* Then you should extend with additional functionality. Bonus tasks if you'd
  like a higher grade (all bonus tasks should be done to receive a higher
  grade).
* When live coding I will not wait for you to follow along. You can if you like,
  but the important part is that you watch and follow. You will get plenty of
  time to figure it out for yourself later. I will publish most/all of the code
  I write for you to access later and feel free to take photos, screenshots or
  record (or help me remember to record). I will also add several videos that
  will explain important concepts in more depth.
* We'll begin most lectures by one (or a few) of you showing your progress or
  results.

## Notes

* took about 2h 30min with 15 minute breaks every hour
* room for about 30 min more content next time
* or talk a bit less and introduce an assignment (a simplier verison of the
  first assignment without useState)
* Make the assignments more clear. Confusing that idea and style assignments has elements also in the first assignment.
* talk about how react (mostly) removes the need for manual DOM-manipulation, jquery !== react 
* introduce some easier exampels of working with destructuring, arrays, object, map, 
* add some more info about basic javascript needed to understand the course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m55PTVUrlnA
* talk more about reusability of components and code (compared to regular html)
* assignments for 1st week should introduce js concents that are heavily used in react. Object and array destructuring. Object manipulation. Arrow functions. Map. Also no vite first week. And not useState. If react only do imports, map, and multiple components on the same page.
* having a line limit for some tasks would be good to help the students focus on quality, and not have to rea through so much when grading
* Even though the outline here is aiming for 3 days of lectures per week, with one of theme being for repetition, it's pretty much a full time job preparing and grading.
