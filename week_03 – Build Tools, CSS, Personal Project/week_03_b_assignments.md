# Week 3 â€“ Build Tools + First React Project

## Show

* Vite (how to build using vite)
* tailwind.css
* Include a custom font
* Publish using Netlify and Vercel.

## Assignment: Build first personal project

* Create new Github Repo
* Build you idea from week 1 (or make a last minut change of idea. If you change
  your idea make a note in your project's README.md about what your new idea is
  about and why you felt your new idea was a better choice).
* Make sure there is some kind of interactivity on your site. I.e something that
  would require JavaScript on a regular html, css, js-site.
* Make sure your choice of design style is well reflected on your site.
* Give credit towards the style you picked. Somewhere on your site provide a
  mention and a link to where you found the style.
* Use the build function in vite to make your site ready for production.
* Publish your site. You can use github pages or one of the other ways of
  publishing that I'll show this week (Netlify or Vercel).
* Make sure to commit and push latest to GitHub repo.
* BONUS: Use tailwind.css for CSS.
