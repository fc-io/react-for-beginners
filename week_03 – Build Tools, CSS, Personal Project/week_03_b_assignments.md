I had a hard time finding a nice video about pixel perfect design. But here are at least som tricks if you use figma.

## Assignment: Build first personal project

* Create new GitHub Repo
* Build you idea and style from week 1 (or make a last minute change of
  style/idea. If you change your idea make a note in your project's README.md
  about what your new idea is and why you felt your new idea was a better
  choice). What is a suitable idea? Check the week 1 assignments or ask if you feel unsure.
* Make sure there is some kind of interactivity on your site. I.e something that
  would require JavaScript on a regular HTML, CSS, js-site.
* Make sure your choice of design style is well reflected on your site. Preferably "pixel perfect".
* Give credit towards the style you picked. Somewhere on your site provide a
  mention and a link to where you found the style.
* Use the build function in vite to make your site ready for production.
* Publish your site. You can use GitHub pages or one of the other ways of
  publishing that I'll show this week (Netlify or Vercel).
* Make sure to commit and push latest to GitHub repo.
