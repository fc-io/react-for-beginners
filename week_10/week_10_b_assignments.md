# Week 10 â€“ Group Project: Assignment

## Presentation of code from group project.

Approximately 20 minutes per group. Here is a simplified example of the presentation layout.

**First, we will go through what is in the app (X speaks):**
1. Here is the intro page, created by X.
2. Here is the home page, with cards. Y created the swipe function, and the rest seen here was done by Z.
3. After swiping on some jobs, one can go to "Saved Jobs". Y created the Saved Jobs page.
4. The Filter page was created by X together with Y. X designed the layout. Y then implemented the filter so that only the correct jobs are visible on the swipe page.
5. The menu was created by Z.

**We used (Y speaks):**
Next, because we wanted to use routes. React-swipe-card, the best swipe library we found. And we used eslint and prettier to maintain a common code style.

**Now each developer will talk about their chosen part (each person speaks about their part individually):**

1. X talks about the filter page.
2. Y talks about the component that implements react-swipe-card.
3. Z talks about the CSS class that changes the appearance of the menu when clicked.
