# React for beginners (a teachers boilerplate)

**Welcome to a beginner's guide to React!**

The content here is mostly thought of as providing an outline to a lecture
series. Each lecture will delve deeper into each topic outlined in this
repository. The repository is meant as a resource both for the teacher and the
students.

The content presented within assumes some familiarity with HTML, CSS and
JavaScript but does not assume any familiarity with Node, NPM, Git or GitHub
(yet here we are ;).
